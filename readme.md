# Teset

Teset (pronounced tea-set) will hopefully become a competent APRS application.
At the moment, Teset is a simple QML/QT mapviewer with some bits tacked on.

## Problems

So far, this will connect over TCP to the APRS Tier 2 servers, pull data from
them, parse it and output that data to the console.

Next up is to try and connect incoming station objects to QML objects. Somehow.

## Requirements
QTLocation 5.7
QTPositioning 5.7
QTQuick 2.5

Hopefully they pull in the QTCore requirements and more. I'm yet to build this
on a non-mine machine. 

That's future hibby's problem.
